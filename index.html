            <p>Hello and welcome!
                Here you can find various articles on parenting related issues and some might say a great place
                to
                meet
                likeminded people that share experiences and grow together.
                Being a parent is hard work, some might say the hardest. When one becomes a parent, their whole
                perspective on life changes( or at least it should).
                The moment your baby enters the world you are his/her guardian, source of food, warmth,
                patience,
                understanding and care, indefinitely. I know some parents agree to take care until one day the
                child
                takes care of themselves but even those parents deep down know that if there ever is a need they
                will be there to fulfill it.
                It's impossible to not worry about or help your child. It is the new state of being that takes
                control once the the baby is born.
                There are countless sites around to teach about how to plan for the birth, what to discuss,
                steps to
                take, stuff to pack, etc. However, there are very few sites that deal with the neurological
                changes
                that occur pre, during and after birth that affect both parents.

                Thoughout several articles I will express my opinions and share experiences about my own life
                and
                parenting.

            <h3>1. How can I help my toddler to talk?</h3>

            <p>Talk as much and as often as you can to your toddler, when you're at home and when you're out and about.
                Research shows that the more you talk to your child, the better she'll become at using and understanding
                language (Weisleder et al 2013).
                When she talks back to you, try to give her your undivided attention if you can. It will encourage her
                to keep talking (DE 2010)! Focus on what your toddler is trying to say, rather than on how clearly she
                pronounces her words (DE 2010). Nodding, smiling and responding to her will help her feel more confident
                about talking to you.
                When she uses words, give her plenty of praise. For example, you could tell her "Yes, that's right, it
                is a spoon – well done!" (DE 2010, NHS 2017) Let your toddler see what you mean, by matching what you do
                to what you say. "Shoes off" you could say, removing her shoes. Then "socks off", removing her socks.
                Get your toddler's attention by saying her name and making eye contact with her (DE 2010). This will
                help her to understand when you’re talking to her.
                Give your toddler plenty of opportunities to talk during everyday activities. If you ask her a question,
                leave a good pause, so that she has time to answer you (NHS 2017). Introduce your toddler to situations
                where she can learn exciting new words. Take her on the bus or for a walk. Point out things you see when
                you're out and about (GOSH 2016, NHS 2017). You can also show her pictures in books and talk together
                about what you can see (GOSH 2016). Repeat back what you hear your toddler trying to say to you, even if
                she doesn't say it clearly. Expand on what she says. So if your toddler says "nana" when she wants a
                banana, you could say "Yes, here's a banana." (DE 2010, NHS 2017)
                Simplify your speech. Use short sentences and emphasise key words when you are talking to your toddler.
                This will help her to focus on the important information. For example, rather than talking in a long
                sentence to say you're going out and she needs to put her shoes on, keep it short, such as, "We're going
                out now, shoes on please." (DE 2010) Use objects and gestures to help your little one understand the
                situation, as well as the words involved. For example, when you ask your little one, "Would you like an
                apple or an orange?" show her each of the fruits as you say the word, so that she realises the
                difference between them, and that there is a choice to be made. Help your toddler to focus her attention
                on what you’re saying to her, by switching off unnecessary background noise such as the TV or radio (DE
                2010, NHS 2017). Children can find it harder than adults to filter out background noise.

            <h3>2.How can I make learning to talk fun? </h3>

            <p>Your toddler loves having fun with you. So if you make talking fun for your toddler, it will encourage
                her to use more words to express herself (DE 2010). Get down on the floor and play with your toddler.
                Let her choose the toy or activity and talk about what she's doing (DE 2010). Join in with your
                toddler's play, repeat the words she’s using and make sure she can see your face and mouth when you
                talk. This will give her lots of opportunities to hear clear examples of the words she's learning (DE
                2010, GOSH 2016). Have fun pretending your toddler's favourite teddy or action figure is real. Include
                the toy in everyday activities. Sit teddy at the table for tea, for example, and put a bib on him. Talk
                about what teddy is doing while he does it. Look at books with your toddler as part of your daily
                routine together. Even if you don't read the story word-for-word, she’ll learn by listening to you
                talking about the pictures (DE 2010, GOSH 2016, NHS 2017). Have fun with nursery rhymes, especially
                those with actions such as "Row, row, row your boat". Verses, stories and songs with repetitive actions,
                rhythms and rhymes will help your toddler to remember the words (DE 2010, NHS 2017). Play games where
                you have to take turns. Learning to wait for her turn will help your toddler to understand the natural
                back-and-forth of conversations (DE 2010, NHS 2017). Try listening games with simple instructions such
                as: Clapping games, where you clap a rhythm, and then wait for your toddler to try to clap the same
                rhythm. Matching the noise of an animal to the right toy or picture. For example, you say "moo" and wait
                for your toddler to pick out a toy cow, or point to a picture of a cow. Gathering together several toys
                that make noises, and making a sound with one of them out of your toddler's sight. Ask your toddler to
                show you which toy made the noise. (DE 2010) You could also try a game of "Simon says". Call out simple
                commands like "Simon says, put your hands on your head" and demonstrate the command yourself. Then let
                your toddler do the same. Carry on with other commands, such as "Simon says put your hands on your
                knees", or "Simon says cross your arms." When the weather's warm, take a big towel or blanket into the
                garden or local park and lie down on it with your toddler. Ask her to close her eyes and listen
                carefully. After a minute or so ask her what she could hear. You can then talk about the wind in the
                trees, birdsong, or a dog barking.

            <h3>3. When should I worry about my child's language development?</h3>

            <p>All children are different, and some develop faster than others. However, it's easy to worry if your
                child
                seems slower to talk or to understand what you say, compared to her sibling or peers. Sometimes, boys
                can be
                slower to talk than girls, or toddlers can talk later if their parents also did (Harding 2014). Ask your
                health visitor or GP for advice, if: by one year of age your child isn't babbling double syllables, such
                as
                'da da' or 'ma ma' by 18 months old, she's using fewer than six words, or showing no signs of
                understanding
                what you’re saying. by two and a half years old, she's unable to speak in two or three word sentences
                (Harding 2014) If necessary, your GP or health visitor will refer your child to a speech and language
                therapist (NHS 2017). Sometimes a hearing test may be recommended too, as undetected hearing problems
                can be
                linked to difficulties learning to talk (DE 2010). If your toddler does have a problem speaking, then
                the
                sooner you seek help, the more likely it is that she'll catch up with her peers (Harding 2014). In many
                cases, all that's needed is a little extra support or reassurance from your health visitor (Harding
                2014).

                other major milestones to look out for. Find out how reading to your toddler improves her language
                skills.

            <h3>4. ABC of potty training</h3>


            <p>Potty training is one milestone that you're probably eagerly awaiting. Though some toddlers adjust in a
                few
                days, bear in mind that it may take your little one several months to get into the potty habit. And
                there
                will be setbacks along the way. Assess your child's readiness for potty training There's no right age to
                start potty training, as every child is different. Parents usually think about training when their child
                is
                between 18 months and three years old. Most children are between two years and two-and-a-half years when
                they start. Don't feel pushed into toilet training your child too soon due to pressure from other
                parents or
                your family. Watch for the signs that your child is ready to start training, and don't start before
                then.
                Talk to your toddler about what you are going to do, and decide what you're going to call wee and poo!
                Make
                potty-training preparations Go on a special trip with your child to buy some new pants and a potty. A
                potty
                is probably easiest to start with, rather than a toilet. It's easy to get on and off, and can be moved
                around the house. However, you may want to buy a training seat to attach to your toilet. If your child
                uses
                a toilet seat, you'll also need a footstep so your child can stabilise himself with his feet and push
                when
                he's having a poo. It will also allow him to get on and off the loo independently. You could show your
                toddler a fun picture book or DVD about using the potty, to get him interested in what's to come. You
                could
                try using training pants for your toddler instead of, or as well as, proper underwear. Cloth training
                pants
                are similar to regular pants, but have an absorbent pad inside to cope with small accidents. Absorbent,
                disposable pull-up trainer pants are especially easy to pull up and down. Some parents find these
                convenient, but some don't find them helpful, as they don't feel very different from a nappy. Wearing
                real
                underwear may encourage your toddler to use his potty. You could let him choose some pants which have
                his
                favourite cartoon character on them. Potty training accessories to help your child There are lots of
                products out there that can help you and your child with potty training. From the potty itself to
                sticker
                charts to praise their progress, there’s plenty of things that could make the potty training journey a
                little bit easier.
