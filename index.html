                <h3>Helping your toddler to talk</h3>
                <h4>In this article
                    How can I help my toddler learn to talk?
                    How can I make learning to talk fun?
                    When should I worry about my child's language development?</h4>

                <p>The more you chat to your toddler, the more opportunities she's likely to have to learn how to talk
                    (DoH
                    2017).
                    <br>
                    But bear in mind that all children are different and learn to talk at different rates (Harding
                    2014).
                    How can I help my toddler learn to talk?
                    Talk as much and as often as you can to your toddler, when you're at home and when you're out and
                    about.
                    Research shows that the more you talk to your child, the better she'll become at using and
                    understanding
                    language (Weisleder et al 2013). When she talks back to you, try to give her your undivided
                    attention if
                    you can. It will encourage her to keep talking (DE 2010)!
                    <br>
                    Focus on what your toddler is trying to say, rather than on how clearly she pronounces her words (DE
                    2010). Nodding, smiling and responding to her will help her feel more confident about talking to
                    you.
                    When she uses words, give her plenty of praise. For example, you could tell her "Yes, that's right,
                    it
                    is a spoon – well done!" (DE 2010, NHS 2017) Let your toddler see what you mean, by matching what
                    you do
                    to what you say. "Shoes off" you could say,
                    removing her shoes. Then "socks off", removing her socks.
                    Get your toddler's attention by saying her name and making eye contact with her (DE 2010). This will
                    help
                    her to
                    understand when you’re talking to her.
                    Give your toddler plenty of opportunities to talk during everyday activities. If you ask her a
                    question,
                    leave a
                    good pause, so that she has time to answer you (NHS 2017).
                    Introduce your toddler to situations where she can learn exciting new words. Take her on the bus or
                    for
                    a
                    walk.
                    Point out things you see when you're out and about (GOSH 2016, NHS 2017). You can also show her
                    pictures
                    in
                    books and talk together about what you can see (GOSH 2016).
                    Repeat back what you hear your toddler trying to say to you, even if she doesn't say it clearly.
                    Expand
                    on
                    what
                    she says. So if your toddler says "nana" when she wants a banana, you could say "Yes, here's a
                    banana."
                    (DE
                    2010, NHS 2017)
                    Simplify your speech. Use short sentences and emphasise key words when you are talking to your
                    toddler.
                    This
                    will help her to focus on the important information. For example, rather than talking in a long
                    sentence
                    to
                    say
                    you're going out and she needs to put her shoes on, keep it short, such as, "We're going out now,
                    shoes
                    on
                    please." (DE 2010)
                    Use objects and gestures to help your little one understand the situation, as well as the words
                    involved.
                    For
                    example, when you ask your little one, "Would you like an apple or an orange?" show her each of the
                    fruits
                    as
                    you say the word, so that she realises the difference between them, and that there is a choice to be
                    made.

                <h3>ABC of potty training</h3>

                <p>In this article
                    Assess your child's readiness for potty training
                    Potty training accessories to help your child
                    Be consistent in your approach to potty training
                    Cope calmly with potty-training accidents
                    Potty training is one milestone that you're probably eagerly awaiting. Though some toddlers adjust
                    in a
                    few
                    days, bear in mind that it may take your little one several months to get into the potty habit. And
                    there
                    will
                    be setbacks along the way.
                    Assess your child's readiness for potty training
                    There's no right age to start potty training, as every child is different. Parents usually think
                    about
                    training
                    when their child is between 18 months and three years old. Most children are between two years and
                    two-and-a-half years when they start.

                    Don't feel pushed into toilet training your child too soon due to pressure from other parents or
                    your
                    family.
                    Watch for the signs that your child is ready to start training, and don't start before then.

                    Talk to your toddler about what you are going to do, and decide what you're going to call wee and
                    poo!

                    Make potty-training preparations

                    Go on a special trip with your child to buy some new pants and a potty. A potty is probably easiest
                    to
                    start
                    with, rather than a toilet. It's easy to get on and off, and can be moved around the house. However,
                    you
                    may
                    want to buy a training seat to attach to your toilet.

                    If your child uses a toilet seat, you'll also need a footstep so your child can stabilise himself
                    with
                    his
                    feet
                    and push when he's having a poo. It will also allow him to get on and off the loo independently. You
                    could
                    show
                    your toddler a fun picture book or DVD about using the potty, to get him interested in what's to
                    come.

                    You could try using training pants for your toddler instead of, or as well as, proper underwear.
                    Cloth
                    training
                    pants are similar to regular pants, but have an absorbent pad inside to cope with small accidents.

                    Absorbent, disposable pull-up trainer pants are especially easy to pull up and down. Some parents
                    find
                    these
                    convenient, but some don't find them helpful, as they don't feel very different from a nappy.
                    Wearing
                    real
                    underwear may encourage your toddler to use his potty. You could let him choose some pants which
                    have
                    his
                    favourite cartoon character on them.
                    Potty training accessories to help your child
                    There are lots of products out there that can help you and your child with potty training. From the
                    potty
                    itself
                    to sticker charts to praise their progress, there’s plenty of things that could make the potty
                    training
                    journey
                    a little bit easier.
