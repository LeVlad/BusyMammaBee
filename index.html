                <h3>Helping your toddler to talk</h3>
                <h4>In this article : <br>
                    <br>How can I help my toddler learn to talk?
                    <br>How can I make learning to talk fun?
                    <br>When should I worry about my child's language development?
                </h4>

                <p><br>The more you chat to your toddler, the more opportunities she's likely to have to learn how to
                    talk
                    (DoH
                    2017).
                    <br>
                    But bear in mind that all children are different and learn to talk at different rates (Harding
                    2014).<br>

                    <br><strong>How can I help my toddler learn to talk?</strong><br>
                    <br>
                    Talk as much and as often as you can to your toddler, when you're at home and when you're out and
                    about. Research shows that the more you talk to your child, the better she'll become at using and
                    understanding language (Weisleder et al 2013). When she talks back to you, try to give her your
                    undivided attention if you can. It will encourage her to keep talking (DE 2010)!
                    Focus on what your toddler is trying to say, rather than on how clearly she pronounces her words (DE
                    2010). Nodding, smiling and responding to her will help her feel more confident about talking to
                    you.
                    <br>
                    When she uses words, give her plenty of praise. For example, you could tell her "Yes, that's right,
                    it is a spoon – well done!" (DE 2010, NHS 2017)
                    Let your toddler see what you mean, by matching what you do to what you say. "Shoes off" you could
                    say, removing her shoes. Then "socks off", removing her socks.
                    Get your toddler's attention by saying her name and making eye contact with her (DE 2010). This will
                    help her to understand when you’re talking to her.
                    <br>
                    Give your toddler plenty of opportunities to talk during everyday activities. If you ask her a
                    question, leave a good pause, so that she has time to answer you (NHS 2017).
                    Introduce your toddler to situations where she can learn exciting new words. Take her on the bus or
                    for a walk. Point out things you see when you're out and about (GOSH 2016, NHS 2017). You can also
                    show her pictures in books and talk together about what you can see (GOSH 2016).
                    Repeat back what you hear your toddler trying to say to you, even if she doesn't say it clearly.
                    Expand on what she says. So if your toddler says "nana" when she wants a banana, you could say "Yes,
                    here's a banana." (DE 2010, NHS 2017)
                    <br>
                    Simplify your speech. Use short sentences and emphasise key words when you are talking to your
                    toddler. This will help her to focus on the important information. For example, rather than talking
                    in a long sentence to say you're going out and she needs to put her shoes on, keep it short, such
                    as, "We're going out now, shoes on please." (DE 2010)
                    Use objects and gestures to help your little one understand the situation, as well as the words
                    involved. For example, when you ask your little one, "Would you like an apple or an orange?" show
                    her each of the fruits as you say the word, so that she realises the difference between them, and
                    that there is a choice to be made.
                    <br>
                    Help your toddler to focus her attention on what you’re saying to her, by switching off unnecessary
                    background noise such as the TV or radio (DE 2010, NHS 2017). Children can find it harder than
                    adults to filter out background noise.

                    <br>
                    <br><strong>How can I make learning to talk fun?</strong><br>
                    <br>
                    Your toddler loves having fun with you. So if you make talking fun for your toddler, it will
                    encourage her to use more words to express herself (DE 2010).
                    <br>
                    Get down on the floor and play with your toddler. Let her choose the toy or activity and talk about
                    what she's doing (DE 2010). Join in with your toddler's play, repeat the words she’s using and make
                    sure she can see your face and mouth when you talk. This will give her lots of opportunities to hear
                    clear examples of the words she's learning (DE 2010, GOSH 2016).
                    <br>
                    Have fun pretending your toddler's favourite teddy or action figure is real. Include the toy in
                    everyday activities. Sit teddy at the table for tea, for example, and put a bib on him. Talk about
                    what teddy is doing while he does it.
                    <br>
                    Look at books with your toddler as part of your daily routine together. Even if you don't read the
                    story word-for-word, she’ll learn by listening to you talking about the pictures (DE 2010, GOSH
                    2016, NHS 2017).
                    <br>
                    Have fun with nursery rhymes, especially those with actions such as "Row, row, row your boat".
                    Verses, stories and songs with repetitive actions, rhythms and rhymes will help your toddler to
                    remember the words (DE 2010, NHS 2017).
                    <br>
                    Play games where you have to take turns. Learning to wait for her turn will help your toddler to
                    understand the natural back-and-forth of conversations (DE 2010, NHS 2017).
                    <br>
                    Try listening games with simple instructions such as:
                    <br>
                    Clapping games, where you clap a rhythm, and then wait for your toddler to try to clap the same
                    rhythm.
                    <br>
                    Matching the noise of an animal to the right toy or picture. For example, you say "moo" and wait for
                    your toddler to pick out a toy cow, or point to a picture of a cow.
                    Gathering together several toys that make noises, and making a sound with one of them out of your
                    toddler's sight. Ask your toddler to show you which toy made the noise.
                    (DE 2010)
                    <br>
                    You could also try a game of "Simon says". Call out simple commands like "Simon says, put your hands
                    on your head" and demonstrate the command yourself. Then let your toddler do the same. Carry on with
                    other commands, such as "Simon says put your hands on your knees", or "Simon says cross your arms."
                    <br>
                    When the weather's warm, take a big towel or blanket into the garden or local park and lie down on
                    it with your toddler. Ask her to close her eyes and listen carefully. After a minute or so ask her
                    what she could hear. You can then talk about the wind in the trees, birdsong, or a dog barking.
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    <br><strong>When should I worry about my child's language development?</strong><br>
                    <br>

                    All children are different, and some develop faster than others. However, it's easy to worry if your
                    child seems slower to talk or to understand what you say, compared to her sibling or peers.
                    Sometimes, boys can be slower to talk than girls, or toddlers can talk later if their parents also
                    did (Harding 2014).
                    <br>
                    Ask your health visitor or GP for advice, if:<br>
                    <br>
                    by one year of age your child isn't babbling double syllables, such as 'da da' or 'ma ma'
                    by 18 months old, she's using fewer than six words, or showing no signs of understanding what you’re
                    saying.
                    <br>
                    by two and a half years old, she's unable to speak in two or three word sentences
                    (Harding 2014)
                    <br>
                    If necessary, your GP or health visitor will refer your child to a speech and language therapist
                    (NHS 2017). Sometimes a hearing test may be recommended too, as undetected hearing problems can be
                    linked to difficulties learning to talk (DE 2010).
                    <br>
                    If your toddler does have a problem speaking, then the sooner you seek help, the more likely it is
                    that she'll catch up with her peers (Harding 2014). In many cases, all that's needed is a little
                    extra support or reassurance from your health visitor (Harding 2014).

                <h3>ABC of potty training</h3>

                <p>In this article :
                    Assess your child's readiness for potty training
                    Potty training accessories to help your child
                    Be consistent in your approach to potty training
                    Cope calmly with potty-training accidents
                    Potty training is one milestone that you're probably eagerly awaiting. Though some toddlers adjust
                    in a
                    few
                    days, bear in mind that it may take your little one several months to get into the potty habit. And
                    there
                    will
                    be setbacks along the way.
                    Assess your child's readiness for potty training
                    There's no right age to start potty training, as every child is different. Parents usually think
                    about
                    training
                    when their child is between 18 months and three years old. Most children are between two years and
                    two-and-a-half years when they start.

                    Don't feel pushed into toilet training your child too soon due to pressure from other parents or
                    your
                    family.
                    Watch for the signs that your child is ready to start training, and don't start before then.

                    Talk to your toddler about what you are going to do, and decide what you're going to call wee and
                    poo!

                    Make potty-training preparations

                    Go on a special trip with your child to buy some new pants and a potty. A potty is probably easiest
                    to
                    start
                    with, rather than a toilet. It's easy to get on and off, and can be moved around the house. However,
                    you
                    may
                    want to buy a training seat to attach to your toilet.

                    If your child uses a toilet seat, you'll also need a footstep so your child can stabilise himself
                    with
                    his
                    feet
                    and push when he's having a poo. It will also allow him to get on and off the loo independently. You
                    could
                    show
                    your toddler a fun picture book or DVD about using the potty, to get him interested in what's to
                    come.

                    You could try using training pants for your toddler instead of, or as well as, proper underwear.
                    Cloth
                    training
                    pants are similar to regular pants, but have an absorbent pad inside to cope with small accidents.

                    Absorbent, disposable pull-up trainer pants are especially easy to pull up and down. Some parents
                    find
                    these
                    convenient, but some don't find them helpful, as they don't feel very different from a nappy.
                    Wearing
                    real
                    underwear may encourage your toddler to use his potty. You could let him choose some pants which
                    have
                    his
                    favourite cartoon character on them.

                    There are lots of products out there that can help you and your child with potty training. From the
                    potty
                    itself
                    to sticker charts to praise their progress, there’s plenty of things that could make the potty
                    training
                    journey
                    a little bit easier.
