            <h3>Helping your toddler to talk</h3>



            <p>In this article
                How can I help my toddler learn to talk?
                How can I make learning to talk fun?
                When should I worry about my child's language development?
                The more you chat to your toddler, the more opportunities she's likely to have to learn how to talk (DoH
                2017).
                <br>
                But bear in mind that all children are different and learn to talk at different rates (Harding 2014).
                How can I help my toddler learn to talk?
                Talk as much and as often as you can to your toddler, when you're at home and when you're out and about.
                Research shows that the more you talk to your child, the better she'll become at using and understanding
                language (Weisleder et al 2013). When she talks back to you, try to give her your undivided attention if
                you can. It will encourage her to keep talking (DE 2010)!
                <br>
                Focus on what your toddler is trying to say, rather than on how clearly she pronounces her words (DE
                2010). Nodding, smiling and responding to her will help her feel more confident about talking to you.
                When she uses words, give her plenty of praise. For example, you could tell her "Yes, that's right, it
                is a spoon – well done!" (DE 2010, NHS 2017) Let your toddler see what you mean, by matching what you do
                to what you say. "Shoes off" you could say,
                removing her shoes. Then "socks off", removing her socks.
                Get your toddler's attention by saying her name and making eye contact with her (DE 2010). This will
                help
                her to
                understand when you’re talking to her.
                Give your toddler plenty of opportunities to talk during everyday activities. If you ask her a question,
                leave a
                good pause, so that she has time to answer you (NHS 2017).
                Introduce your toddler to situations where she can learn exciting new words. Take her on the bus or for
                a
                walk.
                Point out things you see when you're out and about (GOSH 2016, NHS 2017). You can also show her pictures
                in
                books and talk together about what you can see (GOSH 2016).
                Repeat back what you hear your toddler trying to say to you, even if she doesn't say it clearly. Expand
                on
                what
                she says. So if your toddler says "nana" when she wants a banana, you could say "Yes, here's a banana."
                (DE
                2010, NHS 2017)
                Simplify your speech. Use short sentences and emphasise key words when you are talking to your toddler.
                This
                will help her to focus on the important information. For example, rather than talking in a long sentence
                to
                say
                you're going out and she needs to put her shoes on, keep it short, such as, "We're going out now, shoes
                on
                please." (DE 2010)
                Use objects and gestures to help your little one understand the situation, as well as the words
                involved.
                For
                example, when you ask your little one, "Would you like an apple or an orange?" show her each of the
                fruits
                as
                you say the word, so that she realises the difference between them, and that there is a choice to be
                made.
                Help your toddler to focus her attention on what you’re saying to her, by switching off unnecessary
                background
                noise such as the TV or radio (DE 2010, NHS 2017). Children can find it harder than adults to filter out
                background noise.
                How can I make learning to talk fun?
                Your toddler loves having fun with you. So if you make talking fun for your toddler, it will encourage
                her
                to
                use more words to express herself (DE 2010).

                Get down on the floor and play with your toddler. Let her choose the toy or activity and talk about what
                she's
                doing (DE 2010). Join in with your toddler's play, repeat the words she’s using and make sure she can
                see
                your
                face and mouth when you talk. This will give her lots of opportunities to hear clear examples of the
                words
                she's
                learning (DE 2010, GOSH 2016).

                Have fun pretending your toddler's favourite teddy or action figure is real. Include the toy in everyday
                activities. Sit teddy at the table for tea, for example, and put a bib on him. Talk about what teddy is
                doing
                while he does it.

                Look at books with your toddler as part of your daily routine together. Even if you don't read the story
                word-for-word, she’ll learn by listening to you talking about the pictures (DE 2010, GOSH 2016, NHS
                2017).

                Have fun with nursery rhymes, especially those with actions such as "Row, row, row your boat". Verses,
                stories
                and songs with repetitive actions, rhythms and rhymes will help your toddler to remember the words (DE
                2010,
                NHS
                2017).

                Play games where you have to take turns. Learning to wait for her turn will help your toddler to
                understand
                the
                natural back-and-forth of conversations (DE 2010, NHS 2017).

                Try listening games with simple instructions such as:

                Clapping games, where you clap a rhythm, and then wait for your toddler to try to clap the same rhythm.
                Matching the noise of an animal to the right toy or picture. For example, you say "moo" and wait for
                your
                toddler to pick out a toy cow, or point to a picture of a cow.
                Gathering together several toys that make noises, and making a sound with one of them out of your
                toddler's
                sight. Ask your toddler to show you which toy made the noise.
                (DE 2010)

                You could also try a game of "Simon says". Call out simple commands like "Simon says, put your hands on
                your
                head" and demonstrate the command yourself. Then let your toddler do the same. Carry on with other
                commands,
                such as "Simon says put your hands on your knees", or "Simon says cross your arms."

                When the weather's warm, take a big towel or blanket into the garden or local park and lie down on it
                with
                your
                toddler. Ask her to close her eyes and listen carefully. After a minute or so ask her what she could
                hear.
                You
                can then talk about the wind in the trees, birdsong, or a dog barking.
                When should I worry about my child's language development?
                All children are different, and some develop faster than others. However, it's easy to worry if your
                child
                seems
                slower to talk or to understand what you say, compared to her sibling or peers. Sometimes, boys can be
                slower to
                talk than girls, or toddlers can talk later if their parents also did (Harding 2014).

                Ask your health visitor or GP for advice, if:

                by one year of age your child isn't babbling double syllables, such as 'da da' or 'ma ma'
                by 18 months old, she's using fewer than six words, or showing no signs of understanding what you’re
                saying.
                by two and a half years old, she's unable to speak in two or three word sentences
                (Harding 2014)

                If necessary, your GP or health visitor will refer your child to a speech and language therapist (NHS
                2017).
                Sometimes a hearing test may be recommended too, as undetected hearing problems can be linked to
                difficulties
                learning to talk (DE 2010).

                If your toddler does have a problem speaking, then the sooner you seek help, the more likely it is that
                she'll
                catch up with her peers (Harding 2014). In many cases, all that's needed is a little extra support or
                reassurance from your health visitor (Harding 2014).

            <h3>ABC of potty training</h3>

            Approved by the BabyCentre Medical Advisory Board | July, 2021

            <p>In this article
                Assess your child's readiness for potty training
                Potty training accessories to help your child
                Be consistent in your approach to potty training
                Cope calmly with potty-training accidents
                Potty training is one milestone that you're probably eagerly awaiting. Though some toddlers adjust in a
                few
                days, bear in mind that it may take your little one several months to get into the potty habit. And
                there
                will
                be setbacks along the way.
                Assess your child's readiness for potty training
                There's no right age to start potty training, as every child is different. Parents usually think about
                training
                when their child is between 18 months and three years old. Most children are between two years and
                two-and-a-half years when they start.

                Don't feel pushed into toilet training your child too soon due to pressure from other parents or your
                family.
                Watch for the signs that your child is ready to start training, and don't start before then.

                Talk to your toddler about what you are going to do, and decide what you're going to call wee and poo!

                Make potty-training preparations

                Go on a special trip with your child to buy some new pants and a potty. A potty is probably easiest to
                start
                with, rather than a toilet. It's easy to get on and off, and can be moved around the house. However, you
                may
                want to buy a training seat to attach to your toilet.

                If your child uses a toilet seat, you'll also need a footstep so your child can stabilise himself with
                his
                feet
                and push when he's having a poo. It will also allow him to get on and off the loo independently. You
                could
                show
                your toddler a fun picture book or DVD about using the potty, to get him interested in what's to come.

                You could try using training pants for your toddler instead of, or as well as, proper underwear. Cloth
                training
                pants are similar to regular pants, but have an absorbent pad inside to cope with small accidents.

                Absorbent, disposable pull-up trainer pants are especially easy to pull up and down. Some parents find
                these
                convenient, but some don't find them helpful, as they don't feel very different from a nappy. Wearing
                real
                underwear may encourage your toddler to use his potty. You could let him choose some pants which have
                his
                favourite cartoon character on them.
                Potty training accessories to help your child
                There are lots of products out there that can help you and your child with potty training. From the
                potty
                itself
                to sticker charts to praise their progress, there’s plenty of things that could make the potty training
                journey
                a little bit easier.


                Amazon
                A potty of your child’s choice

                It may be Peppa, Paw Patrol or simply the colour of their choice, but letting your child choose the
                potty
                they
                would like to use can be a big help when it comes to getting them to sit on it.

                This My Carry Potty comes in a variety of fun designs, including animals like a bee, ladybird, cow,
                dinosaur,
                penguin, cat and fox. Or, your little one might prefer to choose one of the bright colours available.
                It’s
                also
                designed to be portable so you can take out on the go.

                Available from My Carry Potty, Jo Jo Maman Bebe or Amazon.

                Potty training seat

                If your child would prefer to use the toilet, a training seat can help them by making the toilet hole
                smaller so
                they can sit on it comfortably. It also makes the experience more fun if they choose a seat they want to
                use.
                You can even buy toilet seats which have a smaller seat built in for your little one.

                This Paw Patrol seat is available from Amazon.



                Amazon
                Sticker chart

                Praise will definitely help your child feel every little wee on the potty was worth it. This chart not
                only
                recognises a wee or poo, but also when they just sat and tried, or washed their hands. Deciding on a
                reward
                once
                they reach 10 or 15 stickers can really boost their motivation. There are a wide range of charts
                available
                online that can be used for potty training, even magnetic ones that can be reused later down the line
                for
                other
                tasks to help your child learn.

                This chart is available from Amazon.



                Amazon
                Potty training pants

                Like a slightly thicker pair of pants, these are a great option if you’re out and about and an accident
                may
                be
                really tricky. They offer a lot of protection, but your child won’t feel like they’re still in a nappy.
                There
                are plenty of designs available, or bright colours like these ones which are available on Amazon.



                Amazon
                A book about toilet training

                Reading a book to your child can help them understand about wee, poo and using the toilet. Seeing a
                character
                they can associate with using the potty will hopefully help them want to use a potty. There are lots of
                books
                available, many offering a girls’ version or a boys’ version. It can also be a way to encourage your
                child
                to
                sit on the toilet or potty while you read the book to them and maybe have success while you wait!

                This ‘How do you know you need to go?’ book from Amazon is aimed at all children and includes
                information to
                help those who are resisting pooing in a potty.

                Picture-changing stickers

                Step aside chocolate and sweets, these stickers encourage your child to use the potty by revealing an
                image
                once
                they’re covered in wee! They’re a clever idea and may just be the temptation a reluctant child needs to
                use
                the
                potty. Available from Amazon.

                Waterproof mattress protector

                Dry nights may be a little way off, so a waterproof mattress protector is worth the investment in case
                of
                night-time accidents. This one comes in a range of sizes, including for a cot or cot bed if your child
                hasn’t
                moved up to a single bed yet.

                Available from Amazon.
                Be consistent in your approach to potty training
                Take things slowly to begin with. Encourage your toddler to sit on the potty once a day. This may be
                after
                breakfast, before his bath, or whenever he's likely to have a poo.

                Sit your child on the potty after he has just had a wet or dirty nappy. This reinforces where the wee
                and
                poo is
                meant to go and encourages him to get used to the potty and accept it as part of his routine.

                If he doesn't want to sit on it, that's fine. Never restrain him or force him to sit there. And don't
                push
                the
                issue if he seems scared. If he's not interested, just put a nappy back on him and put the potty aside
                for a
                few
                weeks before trying again. At this stage, you just want him to get used to the potty.

                If he shows an interest, start explaining that this is what Mummy and Daddy, and any older siblings, do
                every
                day. Say that undressing before you sit down to go to the loo is the grown up thing to do.

                If he gets the idea and manages to poo, that's great. But don't push him to perform. Wait until he's
                ready
                and
                demonstrates a clear interest in using the toilet on his own. If you persist when your child is not
                ready,
                he'll
                get upset and you'll become increasingly frustrated, turning toilet training into a battle-ground.</p>
