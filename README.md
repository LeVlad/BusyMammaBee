 BusyMammaBee came about while I was searching for various articles to read so I can have a better idea of what to expect as a young parent. It took some time to realize nothing can prepare you to fully understand what you're about to jump into. With this site I want to help likeminded people connect with each other and learn as much as they can concerning child raising techniques, ideas but also fails and lessons learned.

 # Website Layout #
 
 ## Background ##
 
 - I chose the background to change while scrolling to create a dinamic feel but with no animations using the CSS command "background-image: linear-gradient(62deg, #FBAB7E 20%, #F7CE68 50%, #ffffff 100%);".
 - The tree colours create a relaxing easy-on-the-eyes mix that is neither blank nor flashy.

## 1. Home ##
- The  "Home" section presents the title of the website with the logo and a representative quote
- It is not overly complicated with images, ads, videos or pop-ups.
- It is the top section of the page.

## 2. About ##

- The "About" section gives a bit more information about the purpose of the website and how it came about

## 3. Articles ##

- The "Articles" section relates to the information that will be presented.
- The content of the articles is varied but comprehensive and will continue to develop as time goes by.

## 4. Contact ##
 
 - The "Contact" section of the website gives the user an opportunity to request more information, amend or maybe feedback to the creator/s.

- The navigation bar has been created to stick to the top of the page so as to create an ease in accessibility of the various sections of the website

# User experience #

While browsing the website anyone can :

1. Read specific articles relating to specific issues with babies and toddlers (SPD, ADHD, Weaning, Colic, etc)
2. Further research articles to learn more.
3. Link with FB, TW or IG with likeminded people. (these will need to be set up)
