# BusyMammaBee #

Is a static website where anyone with an interest in what life with children is can have a look and read


# Site overview #

 BusyMammaBee came about while I was searching for various articles to read so I can have a better idea of what to expect as a young parent. It took some time to realize nothing can prepare you to fully understand what you're about to jump into. With this site I want to help likeminded people connect with each other and learn as much as they can concerning child raising techniques, ideas but also fails and lessons learned.

 # Table of contents #

While browsing the website anyone can :

1. Read specific articles relating to specific issues with babies and toddlers (SPD, ADHD, Weaning,Colic, etc)
2. Further research articles to learn more.
3. Link with FB, TW or IG with likeminded people. (these will need to be set up)
