 BusyMammaBee came about while I was searching for various articles to read so I can have a better idea of what to expect as a young parent. It took some time to realize nothing can prepare you to fully understand what you're about to jump into. With this site I want to help likeminded people connect with each other and learn as much as they can concerning child raising techniques, ideas but also fails and lessons learned.
